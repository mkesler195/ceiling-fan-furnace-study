# Analysis

This folder contains notes, interpretations, and analysis related to the
Ceiling Fan / Furnace Study.

The goal of this analysis is not just to collect data, but to understand
patterns, relationships, and implications for energy usage, comfort, and
system behavior.

## What belongs here

Examples of content in this folder include:
- Analysis assumptions and constraints
- Summaries of logged data (runtime, cycles, thresholds)
- Observations about furnace behavior under different conditions
- Comparisons between fan settings (direction, speed, on/off)
- Notes on anomalies, edge cases, or unexpected results
- Questions and hypotheses for future tests

## What does NOT belong here

- Raw firmware or Arduino sketches (see `firmware/`)
- Wiring diagrams or photos (see `docs/`)
- Raw SD card logs (stored separately or referenced as needed)

## Status

This analysis is iterative and evolving. Notes may be partial, provisional,
or revised as new data is collected.
