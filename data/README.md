# Data Logs (SD Card Output)

This folder contains data files written by the **base logger** to the SD card and later copied here for analysis.

The intent is to keep raw or lightly processed data alongside notes and scripts that interpret it.

## Where the data comes from

- Generated by the **upstairs base logger**
- Written to SD card during test runs
- Copied manually into this folder after retrieval

Relevant firmware:
- `firmware/logger/base_logger_sd/base_logger_sd.ino`

## Log file format (conceptual)

Log files are written in a **CSV-style** format (comma-separated values) so they can be opened in:
- spreadsheet tools
- plotting tools
- simple analysis scripts

Each row represents a single record with a timestamp.

### Typical record types

#### 1. Periodic environmental records
Logged at a regular interval.

Fields typically include:
- date
- time
- temperature (°C)
- air pressure (hPa)
- (optional) other local sensor values
